    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jacob Pickrel-Smith</strong> â€” a passionate data scientist with a knack for uncovering insights through traditional machine/deep learning, statistical modeling, and engaging visualizations. I currently hold a MSc. in Data Science from Bellevue University, and am constantly turning raw data into storytelling narratives.</p>

    <p>My journey spans healthcare analytics, environmental data projects, interdisciplinary geospatical analysis, and real-time data pipelines. I'm driven by curiosity and the belief that data is heavily underutilized in many domains. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, making home improvements, programming personal projects, cycling, weightlifting, watching anime, or reading epic novels.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in collaborating or nerding out about really anything (I love when people are passionate!), please reach out!</p>
